instructions: |
  1. You have selected the BMad Method track for brownfield development.

  2. NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP:
     Load the Analyst agent in a new chat and run:
     *document-project

     This will analyze your existing codebase and generate documentation
     that will help AI agents understand your system architecture.

  3. After document-project completes, run:
     *workflow-status

     This will show you the next recommended workflow in the planning phase.

  4. Key workflow sequence for your project:
     - document-project (Analyst) - Prerequisites
     - prd (PM) - Phase 1 Planning
     - create_design (UX Designer) - Phase 1 Planning (conditional on UI)
     - create_architecture (Architect) - Phase 2 Solutioning
     - solutioning-gate-check (Architect) - Phase 2 Solutioning
     - sprint-planning (SM) - Phase 3 Implementation
     - Per-story workflows (SM, DEV) - Phase 3 Implementation

  5. Always use FRESH CHATS for each workflow to avoid context overflow.

  6. Questions? Load any agent and run: *workflow-status
